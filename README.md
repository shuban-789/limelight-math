hashmap_sol --> Solution utilizing the hashmap data structure (Flawed, uses float as a key which may not be the best for Java)
simple_sol_1 --> Solution which stores different combinations of distances (6 altogether) and uses a simple array for storage
simple_sol_2 --> Solution which uses the same selection logic as the hashmap solution (3 combinations) but also uses a simple array for storage

The visual python scripts will output a corresponding graph to go with each solution to visualize the sample. This makes it easier to compare the sample's actual orientation with the output angle which is returned by the solution code
